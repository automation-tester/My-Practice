1. Cucumber is a open source testing tool which supports Behaviour driver development
2. Cucumber defines the behaviour of the application in using simple plain text(feature file)

What is BDD?
>>Writing the acceptance scenarios in the developing stage itself is known as behaviour driven development
>>Cucumber gives us an opportunity develop the test scripts which covers both developer and customer prospective scenarios

How BDD will work?
Write/Describe the scenarios  >>> write the step definations >>> Execute the script if fails >>> modify script >>> run and pass

Advantages of cucumber?
>> it supports multiple languages like Ruby, .net and java
>> No need of more coding knowledge as it is written in the plain text
>> It will setup a bridge between customer and the testscripts
>> It covers end to end testing scenario's
>> Code re-usability is more
