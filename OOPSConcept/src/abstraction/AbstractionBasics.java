	/*Example: Bank ATM 
	Withdraw money, balance enquiry, cash deposits all these options are showing in the ATM GUI but we dont know hwow exactly internal operations are working.
	
	Advantages:
	> Security is more
	> Enhancement is easy(bec end user dont know the operation)
	> Maintainence is easy
	
	
	By using interfaces and Abstract classes we can implement abstraction
